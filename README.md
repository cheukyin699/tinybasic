# tinybasic

A tiny basic editor and interpreter.

For more documentation on how it works, please read some `docs/`.


## Requirements

Please have `g++` and `make` installed. Other alternatives would work, but could
require some tinkering with the `Makefile`.


## Building

`make` should do the trick.


## Running the Examples

The examples are located in the `examples/` folder. You can load them up into
the editor using the load (`l`) command:

```
l examples/fizzbuzz.bas
```

To run it, use the execute (`x`) command:

```
x
```

If you wish to edit the examples, you could either use your own editor, or use
the one built in (though it would be a lot more annoying).
